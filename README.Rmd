## Welcome to MicrogliaMorphologyR!
MicrogliaMorphologyR is an R package for microglia morphology analysis, that is complimentary to ImageJ macro [MicrogliaMorphology](https://github.com/ciernialab/MicrogliaMorphology). Using MicrogliaMorphologyR, you can perform exploratory data analysis and visualization of 27 different morphology features, characterize morphological cluster identities, quantify shifts in morphological populations, generate heatmap and boxplot visualizations of data in flexible ways including at the single-cell level, animal-level, and experimental condition-level, and perform statistical analysis of your data.

## Microglia morphology
Microglia exhibit a dynamic range of morphologies that are context-specific and often rapidly changing in response to environmental cues. While microglia more realistically exist along a continuous spectrum of morphology, we can categorize them by their most commonly observed forms to study microglia morphology. Here, we highlight the four most commonly studied morphological classes, but others have also been characterized including hyper-ramified, dystrophic, satellite, etc. MicrogliaMorphologyR can also be used to characterize additional morphologies beyond these four.

* **Ameboid** = round, few processes
* **Hypertrophic** = thicker, shorter processes with larger soma
* **Rod-like** = elongated soma with bipolar processes
* **Ramified** = smaller soma with long, highly branched processes
